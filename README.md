RayTracer
=========

The ray tracer will be able to handle opaque surfaces with lighting and shadows. This requires the understanding of Phong shading, global illumination, and sphere-triangle intersections using barycentric coordinates. The user can specify which files to read which has information of the light sources, types of objects, and its corresponding color, position, diffusion, and other light properties. Upon completion, jpeg images are stored to display the ray trace.
